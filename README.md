# SplineMeshAsMapMagicOutput
Makes SplineMesh be available as an output in MapMagic with integrated UI.

SplineMesh is https://github.com/benoit-dumas/SplineMesh

In essence it is just a fancy wrapper for the ExampleSower script.

Contains a few bits from the MeshUtils class by zulfajuniadi also. 

This is not carefully put together, simply ripped wholesale from the TownGenerator project for those who might want it.  It could be very easily improved upon and certainly needs a cleanup.

Hope it helps.
